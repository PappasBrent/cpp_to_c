# Transformation Tool

This directory contains the Clang plugin that transforms CPP macros into
C functions. To ease your development setup, we provide a Docker container to
build and test the plugin.

Refer back to the readme file in the main directory on how to start the Docker
container, build the plugin and the wrapper, and run the wrapper script.
